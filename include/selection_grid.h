/**
 * @file selection_grid.h
 *
 * @brief An implementation for a selection grid that handles directional selection.
 *
 * The selection grid is not the same vertically and horizontally.
 * It is divided into rows and each row defines its own callbacks for size, directional changes,
 * and selection input.
 * The idea is that it would be a more fitting simple solution for this game since it tends
 * to be more dynamic horizontally than vertically with differing sizes of hands, jokers, etc.
